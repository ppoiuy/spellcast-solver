# spellcastsolver
Valid Word Finder for Discord's SpellCast Game





How to use:

Fill in text boxes with letters to correspond with SpellCast game grid

Buttons above each text box to change a tile to DL or TL, or 2x (double word value)

Slider represents gem number to calculate number of swaps

Note: avoid using 9+ gems/3 available swaps because it will take 5+ minutes to generate words

Click solve to generate list of best (highest value) words

Note: the same word can be generated multiple times, but with different paths/swapped tiles

Click on an element in the list on the right to see details

checkbox toggles to show if arrows are printed in the details grid







To-do: 

header title for list (Highest Value Words)

highlight first tile in path

change window text of opened windows to the word and value

input for number of scores in list

gem tracker and net gem change 

(annoying to do, maybe toggle button between the other 2 buttons for each tile?)

exit other windows when opening a window?
