Valid Word Finder for Discord's SpellCast Game





How to use:

Fill in text boxes with letters to correspond with SpellCast game grid

Buttons above each text box to change a tile to DL or TL, or 2x (double word value)

Slider represents gem number to calculate number of swaps

Note: avoid using 9+ gems/3 available swaps because it will take 5+ minutes to generate words

Click solve to generate list of best (highest value) words

Note: the same word can be generated multiple times, but with different paths/swapped tiles

Click on an element in the list on the right to see details

Checkbox toggles to show if arrows are printed in the details grid







To-do: 

scrape 1 letter words and banned "profanity" words from word list

gem tracker and net gem change in list
(toggle button under the other 2 buttons for each tile)
