Word Finder for Discord's SpellCast Game

spellcastsolver is a tool designed to help you find valid words in Discord's SpellCast game. It provides a user-friendly interface for inputting letters, modifying tile values, and generating a list of the best words based on their value.

## How to Use

1. Fill in the text boxes with letters that correspond to the SpellCast game grid.
2. Use the buttons located above each text box to change a tile's value. You can set it to DL (Double Letter), TL (Triple Letter), or 2x (Double Word).
3. Adjust the slider to represent the gem number and calculate the number of swaps.
   - Note: Avoid using 9+ gems with only 3 available swaps, as it may take more than 5 minutes to generate words.
4. Click the "Solve" button to generate a list of the best words sorted by their value.
   - Note: The same word may appear multiple times in the list, but with different paths or swapped tiles.
5. To view more details about a specific word, click on the word in the list on the right.
6. Toggle the checkbox to display arrows in the details grid, indicating the path of the word.

## To-Do

There are several improvements planned for SpellCastSolver:

- Scrape 1-letter words and banned "profanity" words from the word list.
- Implement a gem tracker and net gem change in the generated word list.
   - Consider adding a toggle button for each tile under the existing buttons.

Please note that these features are currently under development and will be added in future updates.

For any suggestions, feedback, or issues, please feel free to contribute to the project or contact the repository owner.
